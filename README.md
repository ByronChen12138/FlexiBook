# FlexiBook
The FlexiBook application has a built-in user account for the business owner called owner. Initially, the
password for this account is set to owner, but this can be changed later on. Only the owner may set up
the business, i.e., provide general information about the business and its services. After logging in, the
owner first specifies the name of the business, its address, phone number, and email address as well as
its weekly business hours including lunch breaks, holidays, and vacation.
Then, the owner enters a list of services. Each service has a name and a duration (i.e., how long it takes to
provide this service). For a hairdresser, for example, services may be wash, extensions, color, highlights,
cut, and blow dry. A service is often combined with other services into a sequential series of services
called a service combo. Some services may require another service (e.g., after applying a color, the hair
needs to be washed). Other services may be combined optionally in a specific order (e.g., one may get a
cut and optionally a wash and optionally a blow dry, but the wash has to be done before the cut and the
blow dry after the cut). In a service combo, there is always a main service which is mandatory and
determines the name of the service combo (e.g., in the wash/cut/blow dry combo, cut is the main
service). A service may be the main service for several service combos (e.g., “Cut - Regular” and “Cut -
Deluxe”). Furthermore, some services include a downtime, during which the owner may provide another
service (e.g., a color appointment takes 1 ¼ hours in total, which includes 45min for the application of the
color and 30min of waiting time to let the color set; during these 30min the owner is free to work on
another customer). The owner may update a service or service combo after a warning that all future
appointments of the service or service combo will be affected. The owner may cancel the update of a
service or service combo, if she does not want to change these appointments. The owner may delete a
service or service combo, only if no future appointments exist for the service or service combo.
